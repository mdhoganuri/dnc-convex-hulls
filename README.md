# A2: Divide and Conquer (Convex Hull)

## Benchmarking & Analysis

| # of Points | DNC Hull Time (s) | Naive Hull Time (s) |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 0 | n/a | n/a |
| 1000 | n/a | n/a |
| 2000 | n/a | n/a |
| 3000 | n/a | n/a |
| 4000 | n/a | n/a |
| 5000 | n/a | n/a |
| 6000 | n/a | n/a |
| 7000 | n/a | n/a |
| 8000 | n/a | n/a |
| 9000 | n/a | n/a |

The table above benchmarks the time taken to compute the convex hull of a set of points using the Divide and Conquer (DNC) algorithm and the Naive algorithm. The number of points ranges from 0 to 9000. The time taken is measured in seconds.
